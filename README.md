Notes and maybe problems for AP Computer Science A
I will break down the AP studying process into 4 phases. 

Phase 1: 
notes for all the chapters of a respectable textbook, be it Barrons or Princeton review. 

Phase 2:
solved problems from said textbook. Each problem will be slightly different than the others and thus I intend to futher analyze it. 
My plan is to create generalizations for the problem solving from the problems. 

Phase 3: 
solved AP practice exams and past exams. This further extends phase 2. I plan to analyze the problems and create generalizations for them. 

Phase 4:
using the generlizations from phase 2 and phase 2, phase 4 will create problems that represent different classes of problems. That is, certain problems can 
fall under a certain class, it can be a class that describes problem solving using a particular equation or rule, or otherwise. Phase 4 will basically result in a finite 
set of problems that if solved, would allow you to solve almost every other problem you would come across. I will further note that these generalizations would ideally
involve derivations to some degree.
