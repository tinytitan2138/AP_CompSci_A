Chapter Summary:
Arrays can be single-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, or
more generally, n-dimensional.
739
In a two-dimensional array, each row is an array.
Each element in a two-dimensional array is accessed using the array name,
a row index, and a column index that refer to the elementâ€™s position in the
array.
Concepts such as declaration, instantiation, initial values, indexing, and
aggregate operations from single-dimensional arrays also apply to twodimensional arrays.
Two-dimensional arrays can be instantiated by assigning initial values in a
comma-separated list of comma-separated lists at the declaration.
Each row in a two-dimensional array can have a different number of
columns.
A two-dimensional array has an instance variable, length, which holds the
number of rows in the array.
Each row of a two-dimensional array has an instance variable, length,
which holds the number of elements in that row.
The ArrayList class implements generics and is part of the java.util
package.
An ArrayList can be thought of as an expandable single-dimensional array
of objects.
To define an ArrayList to hold elements of primitive data types, use the
wrapper classes.
An ArrayList object expands automatically as needed as objects are added.
We access an element of an ArrayList via its index.
We can process each element in an ArrayList using the enhanced for loop.
