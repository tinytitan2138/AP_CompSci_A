/**
 * Chapter Summary:
 *Basic components of a computer include the CPU, memory, a hard disk,
 * keyboard, monitor, and mouse.
 * Each type of CPU has its own set of instructions for performing arithmetic
 * and logical operations, moving data, and changing the order of execution
 * of instructions.
 * An operating system controls peripheral devices, supports multitasking,
 * allocates memory to programs, and prevents the user from damaging the
 * system.
 * Computer networks link two or more computers so that they can share
 * resources, such as files or printers.
 * The Internet connects millions of computers around the world. Web servers
 * deliver webpages to clients running Internet browsers.
 * Binary numbers are composed of 0s and 1s. A bit holds one binary digit. A
 * byte holds eight binary digits.
 * To convert a binary number to a decimal number, multiply each digit in the
 * binary number by 2
 * position−1
 * , counting the rightmost position as position 1
 * and moving left through the number. Then add the products together.
 * To convert a decimal number into a binary number, first find the largest
 * power of 2 that is smaller than or equal to the decimal number, subtract
 * that number from the decimal number, then do the same with the remainder,
 * and so on, until you reach 0.
 * Hexadecimal digits can be used to represent groups of four binary digits.
 * The Unicode character set, which Java uses, can encode up to 65,536
 * characters using 16 bits per character.
 * Machine language and assembly language are early forms of programming
 * 68
 * languages that require the programmer to write to the CPU’s instruction
 * set. Because this low-level programming is time consuming and difficult,
 * and the programs are not portable to other CPU architectures, machine
 * language and assembly language are rarely used.
 * High-level languages are highly symbolic and somewhat portable. They can
 * be compiled, interpreted, or as in the case of Java, converted to byte
 * codes, which are interpreted at run time.
 * A good program is readable, easily maintained, and reusable.
 * Object-oriented programming uses classes to encapsulate data and the
 * functions needed to manipulate that data. Objects are instantiated
 * according to the class design. An advantage to object-oriented
 * programming is reuse of the classes.
 * Programs use a combination of sequential processing, method calls,
 * selection, and iteration to control the order of execution of instructions.
 * Performing operations in order, one after another, is called sequential
 * processing. Temporarily executing other code, then returning, is called a
 * method call. Selecting which code to execute based on the value of data is
 * called selection. Repeating the same code on each item in a group of
 * values is called iteration, or looping.
 * Pseudocode allows a programmer to design a program without worrying
 * about the syntax of the language.
 * In programming, you will often perform tasks for which there are standard
 * methods of processing, called algorithms. For example, accumulating is a
 * common programming operation that finds the sum of a group of numbers.
 * Programming, in large part, is reducing a complex task to a set of subtasks
 * that can be implemented by combining standard algorithms that use
 * sequential processing, selection, and looping.
 * Java source code is stored in a text file with an extension of .java.
 * Compiling the code produces one or more .class files.
 * An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) consists of a program
 * editor, a compiler, and a run-time environment, integrated via a Graphical
 * User Interface.
 * Compiler errors are detected by the compiler and are usually caused by
 * incorrect Java syntax or misspellings. Run-time errors are detected by the
 * Java Virtual Machine and are usually caused by exceptions or incorrect
 * use of classes. Logic errors occur during program execution and are
 * caused by incorrect program design.
