        when calling a inherited method, you need
        the parenthesis. You dont inherit constructors.
        The methods is abstract and interfaces dont need to be
        public. Method overriding is when the subclass
        implements a method from the parent class. Polymorphism
        is when multiple methods exist for differing subclasses.
        If you let A a = new B, a cant reference the new
        methods of B, You can only cast upwards. You cant create
        objects from abstract classes. You can declare referances of
        abstract classes but cant construct them. When answering questions
        on interfaces, actually analyze what is needed to implement them.
