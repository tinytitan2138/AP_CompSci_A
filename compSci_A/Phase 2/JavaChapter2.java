Chapter Summary:
Java programs consist of at least one class.
Identifiers are symbolic names for classes, methods, and data. Identifiers
should start with a letter and may contain any combination of letters and
digits, but no spaces. The length of an identifier is essentially unlimited.
Identifier names are case sensitive.
Java’s reserved words cannot be used as identifiers.
The basic building block of a Java program is the statement. A statement is
terminated with a semicolon and can span several lines.
Any amount of white space is permitted between identifiers, Java
keywords, operands, operators, and literals. White space characters are
the space, tab, newline, and carriage return.
A block, which consists of 0, 1, or more statements, starts with a left curly
brace and ends with a right curly brace. Blocks can be used anywhere in
the program that a statement is legal.
Comments are ignored by the compiler. Block comments are delineated
by  and . Line comments start with // and continue to the end of the line.
        Java supports eight primitive data types: double, float, long, int, short,
        byte, char, and boolean.
        Variables must be declared before they are used. Declaring a variable is
        specifying the data item’s identifier and data type. The syntax for declaring
        a variable is: dataType identifier1, identifier2, …;
        125
        Begin variable names with a lowercase letter. If the variable name consists
        of more than one word, begin each word after the first with a capital letter.
        Do not put spaces between words.
        An integer data type is one that evaluates to a positive or negative whole
        number. Java recognizes four integer data types: int, short, long, and byte.
        Floating-point data types store numbers with fractional parts. Java supports
        two floating-point data types: the single-precision type float, and the
        double-precision type double.
        The char data type stores one Unicode character. Because Unicode
        characters are encoded as unsigned numbers using 16 bits, a char variable
        is stored in two bytes of memory.
        The boolean data type can store only two values, which are expressed using
        the Java reserved words true and false.
        The assignment operator (=) is used to give a value to a variable.
        To assign an initial value to a variable, use this syntax when declaring the
        variable:
        Literals can be used to assign initial values or to reassign the value of a
        variable.
        Constants are data items whose value, once assigned, cannot be changed.
        Data items that you know should not change throughout the execution of a
        program should be declared as a constant, using this syntax:
        Constant identifiers, by convention, are composed of all capital letters with
        underscores separating words.
        An expression consists of operators and operands that evaluate to a single
        value.
        The value of an expression can be assigned to a variable or constant, which
        must be a data type compatible with the value of the expression and cannot
        be a constant that has been assigned a value already.
        Java provides binary operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
        division, and modulus.
        Calculation of the value of expressions follows the rules of operator
        precedence.
        126
        Integer division truncates any fractional part of the quotient.
        When an arithmetic operator is invoked with operands that are of different
        primitive types, the compiler temporarily converts, or promotes, one or
        both of the operands.
        An expression or a variable can be temporarily cast to a different data type
        using this syntax:
        Shortcut operators ++ and −− simplify incrementing or decrementing a
        value by 1. The prefix versions precede the variable name and increment
        or decrement the variable, then use its new value in evaluation of the
        expression. The postfix versions follow the variable name and increment
        or decrement the variable after using the old value in the expression.
        Java provides shortcut operators for each of the basic arithmetic
        operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
