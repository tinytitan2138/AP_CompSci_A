        unlike sequential search, order matters for
        binary search. Some sorting algorthms dont take into
        account negative numbers, especially if it is using the
        compareTo method. There are problems where you will need to
        figure out what will happen after some number of iterations.
        There are questions in which you will need to know the
        comparison between different algorithms. For strings, they need
        to be in alphabetical order for binary search to work.
        The merge function produces a permanant array. There are
        also questions of the average number of times for something.
