        Conclusions, some questions ask
        for the implementation code. Always
        read the classes before answering the questions.
        Parameter names can be the same but signatures
        must be different. Null objects cant be
        called with methods. A client program cannot access a private instance variable.
        every new keyword creates an object, any time you
        set some object equal to an already existing object you
        get a bunch of identifiers pointing to the same object. Read the variables
        closely.
