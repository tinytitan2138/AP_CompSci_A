        Tail recursion is when the last statement is the recursive function. It
        is not always used in divide and conquer algorithms. Processes are simpler cases, and
        every recursive algorithm can be defined iteratively. For recursive functions, draw
        out the call stack and write whats going to happen. A recusrive call can serve the
        process of iteration. For multiple recursive calls draw out a recursive call
        tree.
