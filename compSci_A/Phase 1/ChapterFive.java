    Some important aspects of coding is actual program design itself. One design technique is called the
    waterfall model. It is visualized as analysis of specification at the top, with a line connecting
    it to program design, then implementation, then testing and debugging, and finally maintenance.
    Analysis of specification is simply the description of the problem itself, constraints and otherwise.
    Program design is simply the design of the solution, it can be thought of as a plan to achieve
    whatever the goal is, it includes the methods, techniques, objects, etc. Program implementation is
    simply the coding part. The testing part is just testing out all the cases of the program,
    it may be to add in negative values if the program only works for positive numbers etc. The testing
    phase also involved resolving errors, they can be compiled time errors, errors in which certain lines
    of code cant be compiled into byte code, run time errors in which they occur during the execution of the
    program, like index out of bounds or basically anything with an exception call, and finally the hardest being
    logic errors, in which the code executes, but it still doesn't do what was intended. Good programs
    account for user error, I personally just like to use custom-made exceptions and exception handling.
    Another important process is upgrading, like adding new features to the code and what not. OOP basically
    follows this:
    • Identify classes to be written.
    • Identify behaviors (i.e., methods) for each class.
    • Determine the relationships between classes.
    • Write the interface (public method headers) for each class.
    • Implement the methods
