        AP Computer Science A has different types of labs, there may be questions regarding
        these labs on the test. One such lab is called the magpie lab, it is a chat bot which students
        modify. You would often use string methods, some important skills to have been: count the
        number of occurrences of a substring within a string, replace all substrings with another,
        and to remove all substring within a string. These are important to know for the lab as the lab
        needs you to search for occurrences within a string to formulate a response. Another important
        lab is the elevens lab, it is essentially a card playing game, it can be solitaire or something else.
        Important components are the cards, the deck of cards, the board itself which is inherited from the
        board class (or implemented), and finally the shuffle function. I will note that the shuffle function
        makes some card within the array randomly one of the other cards, this prevents duplication. A deck
        of cards has 52 cards. A lot of emphasis is put on testing and debugging within the elevens lab;
        I will also note that you need to simulate random events, e.g. tossing a coin. I note that for the
        elevens lab and this other lab, the picture lab, you need a GUI, but this GUI is provided, and you
        will not be tested on it within the AP exam. The picture lab basically involves manipulating an
        image that is modeled with a 2-d array. Array traversals are then important, same with UML diagrams,
        these diagrams essentially help software engineers model different aspects of their software and how
        they relate to each other. Here are some important aspects of the picture lab: • Learning how colors are stored in a program.

        • Modifying a picture.
        • Creating a mirror image of a picture.
        • Mirroring part of a picture.
        • Creating a collage.
        • Detecting the edge of a picture.

         The actual implementation of these projects will be done by me during Phase 2. These
         projects are not that trivial, and thus they constitute being an actual problem.

Chapter 9 summary:
String manipulation and matrix processing are the two big topics you should master.
Review the meanings and boundary conditions of the parameters in the String methods substring and indexOf. For matrices, you should nail down both the row-column
and for-each traversals. Remember, you cannot use a for-each loop for the replacement
of elements.

Be sure you can hand-execute tricky matrix algorithms, like those used for modifying matrices using mirror images.
A matrix is an array of row-arrays, so familiarize yourself with the use of a
method with an array parameter to process the rows of a matrix.
Array manipulation is another big topic. Be sure you know how to shuffle the
elements of an array.
Other concepts emphasized in the labs are inheritance and polymorphism, writing
subclasses, abstract classes, simulation of events using random numbers, multi-base
numbers, and conditional (if...else) statements. You should have all of these at
your fingertip
